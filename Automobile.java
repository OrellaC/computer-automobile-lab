//Create a class Automobile with variables number_of_tires and type, inherit and create subclasses with two number of tires (bikes) and four number of tires and type car, truck or bus. When instantiating the object, use the constructor.
//Create two Rectangle objects with a method Area which returns the area of each triangle. Length and width of two triangles should be passed as parameters to the constructor (6,8) and (9,11).
//Write a program to print the area and perimeter of a triangle of sides of 3, 4 and 5 units by creating a class named 'Triangle' without any parameter in its constructor. Use this two step process:
//Step 1: Calculate "s" (half of the triangles perimeter): s =  a+b+c2
//Step 2: Then calculate the Area: herons formula A = sqrt( s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) )
//Write a program that would print the information (name, year of joining, salary, address) of three employees by creating a class named 'Employee'.
